  # Uncomment below - you can declare relations between models like this

  # posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "UserPosts")


# Uncomment the model below as well

# type Post @model {
#   id: ID! @isUnique
#   title: String!
#
#   # Every relation also required a back-relation (to determine 1:1, 1:n or n:m)
#   author: User! @relation(name: "UserPosts")
# }
